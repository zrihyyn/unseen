                The work explores the relationship between body, space, and identity through a decolonial lens. The two artists address issues of history and migration via the body, investigating marginalized histories and their remnants, revealing forgotten historical pains we have overlooked.</div>

                I’m not making the work from a resolved position of: I get this and I’m healed from this and I want to highlight this. Instead, it’s really from a position of: I don’t get this.<br>Lungiswa Gqunta:
                I try to look at how history persists today, how it presents itself and how it continues to uproot us from the place that we have made home.<br>Lakisha Apostel: 
                The performance occurs with or without the audience. It’s not a performance that I do for beople to see. It exists on its own because it needs to.
                I don’t understand how this works within me, but I feel it around me.</div>

            <div class="item"><sup><i>exhibition</i></sup>Circulate 21 – Photography Beyond Frames<br>
                <sup><i>location</i></sup>Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam<br>
                The exhibition showcases works that approach photography in innovative ways, emphasizing the medium’s potential beyond conventional boundaries. In this context, photography is not just a technical tool or a final product but a vehicle for the artist’s perspective. This approach resonates with the idea of marginalized perspectives, as the exhibition highlights how overlooked or disregarded aspects of photography can be reintroduced and given new meaning.
                The title Circulate refers to the cyclical nature of images, constantly shifting in meaning. This mirrors how marginalized narratives or neglected experiences can resurface and gain new significance, breaking free from traditional frameworks. The artists in this exhibition challenge conventional photographic boundaries, reclaiming and reinterpreting marginalized histories and perspectives, offering new, inclusive viewpoints.
                Thus, the exhibition serves as a reminder that images, much like marginalized voices, continuously circulate, transform, and evolve, allowing for the discovery of previously overlooked meanings and stories.</div>

            <div class="item">Image: Pictorial Fields No. 01-09<br>Image: Detail</div>
            <div class="item"><i>Pictorial Fields No. 01-09</i> by Jaya Pelupessy<br>
                Pelupessy, who studies the history of early photographic techniques, reinterprets the medium of photography. He created a photo-collage series using silkscreen frames, which are typically used to print images. By incorporating the production process into the artwork itself, he challenges the conventional use of these frames. <i>Pictorial Fields No. 01-09</i> was created using the same method.
                The theme of the work is “doomscrolling,” the act of endlessly scrolling through news websites and social media, which leads to desensitization to the content we consume. In <i>Pictorial Fields</i>, the series of works gradually shifts from readable screens on the left to empty screens on the right, and from abstract forms to darker screens as one moves from right to left. 
                Pelupessy illustrates how images, while scrolling, are perceived not as individual photographs but as part of a continuous flow. He brings the tools of photo production to the forefront, demonstrating that the process is not a temporary “step” toward the result but an inherent event within the final outcome.</div>

            <div class="item">Image: Semâ Bekirovic, Of Fire<br>The Dragon is the Greatest of All Animals but No One Actually Sees It.</div>
            <div class="item"><i>Of Fire</i> by Sema Bekirovic<br>
            Bekirovic suggests that the role of the artist in an artwork may be less significant than we think. Many of her works are created by uncontrollable elements such as natural processes, animals, or museum visitors. 
            In <i>Of Fire</i>, Bekirovic filmed the process of artist Xu XueQin sculpting a dragon from clay using a thermal camera. The video includes quotes regarding the symbolic meanings of dragons across various cultures, eras, and religions.
             Through this work, Bekirovic emphasizes that dragons, in the end, are born from human fears and desires. Ultimately, the work asserts that when we perceive an image, it is shaped by uncontrollable elements, leading to a distortion of our perception.</div>

            <div class="item">Strategies for <i>Marginalized</i> Futures</div>
            <div class="item"><sup><i>exhibition</i></sup>Taking Root Among the Stars<br>
            <sup><i>location</i></sup>W139 Amsterdam<br>This exhibition presents works that imagine the future through feminist, queer, Black diasporic, and decolonial perspectives.
            Using science fiction, the artists reconstruct future societies, proposing new social realities where marginalized groups are at the center. This offers a critical reflection on how voices that have been sidelined can be re-centered in the way we envision the future.</div>

            <div class="item">Image: Octavia E. Butler<br>Image: Brittany Nelson, I Can Hardly Bear It When It is Over, I Can Hardly Bear It When It Starts</div>
            <div class="item">The year 2024 marks the beginning of Octavia E. Butler’s trailblazing 1993 science fiction book <i>Parable of the Sower,</i> from the Earthseed trilogy. In light of this important movement in time, artists Müge Yilmaz and Anna Hoetjes have initiated Taking Root Among the Stars.
                Emerging and expanding from the legacy of Butler’s work, this exhibition marks a year when the future became the present became the past.<br>
                <i>EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING SATURDAY, JULY 20, 2024:<br>
                All that you touch You change<br>
                All that you Change Changes you.<br>
                The only lasting truth<br>
                Is Change.<br>
                God<br>
                Is Change</i><br>
                Brittany Nelson’s video <i>I Can Hardly Bear It When It is Over, I Can Hardly Bear It When It Starts (2022)</i> poetically explores collapse, reflecting on the 2020 fall of the Arecibo Telescope in Puerto Rico. Interwoven with this imagery are excerpts from 1970s letters between science fiction writers James Tiptree Jr. (Alice Sheldon) and Ursula K. Le Guin. Sheldon’s work, which explored closeted sexuality through alien metaphors, examines how marginalized identities and futures are shaped by personal and cosmic disruptions. Over 500 letters, filled with flirting and homoerotics, are transformed into a poetic narrative that connects personal and societal collapse, offering a strategy for imagining marginalized futures amidst deconstruction and change.</div>

            <div class="item"><sup><i>text</i></sup>The Arts and Crafts of Today<br><sup><i>by</i></sup>William Morris<br>In this text, Morris critiques how industrialization commodifies and alienates art and labor, emphasizing the need to apply art to practical purposes for beauty and pleasure. This serves as an important backdrop for exploring how we can recover and reframe marginalized forms of art and communal creative practices.</div>

            <div class="item"><i>It is possible to be happy, that labor may be a pleasure; nay, that the essence of pleasure abides in labor if it be duly directed; that is if it be directed towards the performance of those functions which wise and healthy people desire to see performed; in other words, if mutual help be its moving principle.<br>(...)<br>We artists are in this position, that we are the representatives of craftsmanship which has become extinct in the production of market wares. Let us therefore do our very best to become as good craftsmen as possible.<br>(...)<br>The purpose of applying art to articles of utility is twofold: first, to add beauty to the results of the work of man, which would otherwise be ugly; and secondly, to add pleasure to the work itself, which would otherwise be painful and disgustful.<br>(...)<br>If the function of art is to make labor pleasurable, what is the position in which we must find ourselves without it? One of two miseries must happen to us: either the necessary work of our lives must be carried on by a miserable set of helots for the benefit of a few lofty intellects; or if, as we ought to do, we determine to spread fairly the burden of the curse of labor over the whole community, yet there the burden will be, spoiling for each one of us a large part of that sacred gift of life.</i></div>

            <div class="item"><sup><i>lecture</i></sup>Ruben Pater of Untold Stories at Insights 2020<br><sup><i>source</i></sup>Walker Insights Design Lecture Series<br>Ruben Pater’s Insights 2020 lecture explores the relationship between design, politics, and visual communication. His work focuses on translating complex, sensitive, or low-profit political issues into visual forms to spark public attention. Pater emphasizes that design plays a crucial role beyond aesthetic expression, functioning within social and political contexts. In his book The Politics of Design, he discusses how design contributes to maintaining power structures and how designers can critically examine these structures. Through design, Pater provides valuable insights into critiquing social structures and power dynamics while reexamining marginalized voices and histories.</div>

            <div class="item"><i>Love Compost Hate Fascism (2020)</i><br>Fascism is a politics of thoughtlessness based only on fear, but supported by industrialists because they are the ones profiting from destruction... A kind of abstract primitivism and regionalism is invoked by fascism, but one that still depends on technology, a global capitalist economy, and slave labour in the Global South.<br>
            <i>Do You Hate Your Boss? (2020)</i><br>You probably have faced bad conditions at work at one point in your life; unpaid overtime, a pay cut, working weekends, a toxic work environment, or a boss that refuses to give you a raise even though the company makes a profit.<br>
            <i>Who Owns the City? (2018)</i><br>The less fortunate Amsterdammers who do not own property are the ones who pay the price. Real estate prices have driven up rents, forcing families to leave their city. Children born in Amsterdam are unlikely to stay in the city unless their parents own property.<br>
            <br>Ruben Pater’s work redefines design as a tool for challenging power structures and addressing inequality. By focusing on exploitation and resistance, he shows how design can empower marginalized voices and inspire more inclusive, socially responsible practices.</div>
